This project was completed using the STM32F407VG. An external thermistor is read using DMA on ADC3. The Internal die temperature is read using DMA on ADC1. The temperature values are read continuously, and stored in an array containing 100 values. The orange on-board LED also blinks continuously continuously at a half-second rate.
