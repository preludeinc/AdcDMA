This project was a lab exercise completed using the STM32F407VG. In this project, an external thermistor is read using DMA on ADC3. The Internal die temperature is read using DMA on ADC1. The temperature values are read continuously into an array of 100 values. The orange on-board LED also blinks continuously continuously at a half-second rate.
